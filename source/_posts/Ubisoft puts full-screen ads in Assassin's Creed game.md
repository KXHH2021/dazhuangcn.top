## Ubisoft puts full-screen ad in Assassin's Creed game

On Nov. 24, French gaming media reporter Fab encountered a bad thing while playing Assassin's Creed: Odyssey - when he tried to open the map menu to check his location, the game popped up an anachronistic Assassin's Creed: Phantasmagoria full-screen advertisement.

This isn't the first time Ubisoft has put ads in its own games - all of the Assassin's Creed titles released in recent years have had the Animus online store built into the main interface for promotional purposes, but it's the first time it's appeared in the form of a full-screen pop-up like this.

The full-screen ads have been tested on the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions of the game. It's common for ads to appear in free-to-play games to recoup costs, but it's probably not appropriate for players to be forced to watch ads after they've paid for the game, not to mention that inserting ads into the game will undoubtedly disrupt the game's immersive and immersive experience, which will inevitably lead to discontent from gamers.

Earlier this month, Xbox owners reported that a full-screen advertisement for Call of Duty 20: Modern Warfare 3 appeared when they booted up their console, and we don't know if Ubisoft used this as inspiration for their Assassin's Creed: Visions ads, or if they'll be installing full-screen advertisements for more games in the future.

## Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism replicates dam project in My World

On November 16, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism's Public Works Office in Japan, which is in charge of the Tachino Dam, dropped an amazing video on the tubes: a model of the Tachino Dam, which is under construction, recreated in My World.

Tachino Dam is a direct-flow dam under construction in Kumamoto Prefecture, with the left bank of the dam adjacent to Otsu City, the right bank adjacent to Minamiso Village, and the downstream portion of the dam leading from Shirakawa to the Ariake Sea. The dam is 87 meters high and 197 meters wide, and the pouring of concrete for the dam body was completed in May of this year, and it is scheduled to be officially opened in 2024.

In the Tachino Dam recreation video, both the project under construction in reality and the unfinished portion of the project have been recreated 1:1 in the game, and the surrounding terrain, including trees, roads, and other buildings, has also been carefully created. However, due to the complexity of the scene, the demo video even showed significant lag, so it seems that it is time to upgrade the computer configuration of the dam construction team.
