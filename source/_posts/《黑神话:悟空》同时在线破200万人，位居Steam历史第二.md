I thought **Black Myth: Goku** would do surprisingly well on its first day, but I didn't expect this kind of pomp and circumstance.6

After a long four-year wait, Black Myth finally went on sale on August 20, breaking several historical records in less than 24 hours.

First of all, from the data to visualize: one hour after the game was released, the number of people online at the same time on **Steam** reached one million, surpassing the strength of predecessors such as **“Eldon's Law Ring”**  and **“Bode's Gate 3”** in one fell swoop.

Three hours later, the number of Black Myths online at the same time exceeded 1.4 million people, reaching the fourth Steam simultaneous online list, but also broke the highest Steam pure single-player game online record held by 2077.

It should also be emphasized that today is a Tuesday workday, and Black Myth's release time is 10:00 a.m., but it only took a few hours to break the record. By the time everyone had gotten off work after a hard day's work, Black Mythos' online numbers had further gained momentum, first surpassing CS2's all-time peak (1.8 million) and then Phantom Beasts Paroo's all-time peak (2.1 million), and coming directly to Steam's all-time second place for simultaneous online numbers.

## As of press time, that number is set at 2.22 million:

And that's just the publicly-visible numbers on Steam; add in the rest of the platforms like consoles and WeGame, and Black Mythos's first-day results will only get more exaggerated.

Moreover, today we have already seen the “New Year's Eve” scene: basically, no matter which video platform or live broadcasting platform you cut to, you will see Black Myths everywhere, with the feeling of “New Year's Eve is the Spring Festival Gala on any station”. Even in addition to the game anchors, many people outside the circle was also to come. It can be said that no matter “master what you did before work”, today broadcast “Black Myth” are no sense of contradiction.

This kind of frenzy has also spread to foreign countries, Youtube, Twitch and other mainstream overseas platforms, “Black Myth” has become a popular hashtag, the opening scene is also crowded. In front of this game, as if there is a kind of “all brothers within the four seas” situation, many live broadcasting room is also not to hide the enthusiasm, the enthusiasm of opening champagne is not even inferior to the domestic.

Years of popularity accumulation, the game itself is excellent quality, the hard work of the game in the content finally bear fruit today, as of the end of the article, the game's Steam evaluation number has exceeded 50,000, the overall favorable rate of 96%, stable in the praise as the tide.

Of course, as we said in our previous review, “Black Myth” is not a myth, it may be a miracle, but it is still in line with the natural development of the law of things”, and most of the game will be on the line will have accidents such a law, ‘Black Myth’ today also inevitably encountered a number of times.

The game's bad reviews are currently focused on optimization issues, some players in the comments section pointed out that the game still exists in a variety of operational problems, but also detailed with the solution. Before waiting for an update from Yuko, if any of our readers and friends have also encountered problems, they might as well go to the comments section to check out the solutions for various different hardware as well.

In addition to optimization issues, counting the story of these days, everyone in order to the first time to “face the fate of the sky”, but also experienced the “81 difficulties”, and even started the day before the game went on sale.

Before the release of the game, all kinds of linkage is endless. Yesterday, Ruixing's buy coffee and get a free flash card, including myself, also early in the morning on time squatting, the result in front of the enthusiasm of the players, Ruixing more than 10,000 stores across the country almost did not hold, less than a moment of merchandise was swept away.

If you must say, this kind of heat will also bring a little “trouble”, for example, “how to take time off to play the game on weekdays” is an indispensable terrain in the gaming circle, but in this kind of heat that breaks the circle, it may be difficult to get the boss to grant leave like never before.

Players who stayed in front of the screen on time also had “surprises”. After the game was released on time at 10:00 a.m., people realized that the game was still one step short of decompression, and players encountered different problems for this reason: some players might not have the right equipment, and were directly stupefied by the hours of decompression time, while others had to vacate their storage space, and also had to consider which games they wanted to uninstall. Some have to free up storage space and think about which games to uninstall.

Interestingly, in GameDiscoverCo's estimated statistics, nearly 90% of the spending on Black Myths comes from China, and according to this data, the upper limit of Chinese players' spending in the gaming market can be said to have been raised by a large extent, proving once again that China's gaming market is a pivotal position.

## Embarking on the path of fetching scriptures is more important than arriving at the spiritual mountain.

The story of Yuke will continue, and jokingly, in addition to continue to optimize and improve the game, we should not forget that the Xbox players in the distance are still waiting.
