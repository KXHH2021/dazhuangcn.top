The first round of Swiss Round has come to an end and the next rounds will be even more exciting!

Each round will be a fierce duel between teams of equal strength. Only the first team to achieve 3 wins will advance, while the team with 3 losses will be ruthlessly eliminated.

Inevitably, we will witness intra-region wars, as well as a showdown between the LCK and LPL in the process.

There will no longer be a region circumvention mechanism in the second round of the Swiss round and beyond, so let's wait and see what happens and witness the intense clashes between the top teams!
