Ruler and Kanavi's players are all in action, and the Korean team is winning the battle for resources in the wild area.

This year's Hangzhou Asian Games saw e-sports become an official sport, and both the Chinese team, as hosts, and the Korean team, which is the favorite to win the title, attached great importance to it.

From the deployment of troops, first of all, the Chinese team, in June this year, the League of Legends Chinese team announced the final list of six people, six people are Bai Jiahao (ID: 369), Chen Zebin (ID: Bin), Tian Ye (ID: Meiko), Yu Wenbo (ID: Jackeylove), Zhao Lijie (ID: Jiejie) and Zhuo Ding (ID: Knight), the lineup configuration is very good: Knight), the lineup configuration is very luxurious.

Even with the substitutions, the Chinese team's staffing remains top-notch. First of all, the three players from BLG team, Chen Zebin, Peng Lixun and Zhao Jiahao, have already shown their strong "anti-Korean" ability. In the MSI tournament held in London, England in May this year, the BLG team in the loser's bracket, first zero points of the South Korean LCK region's first seed GEN.G team, and then with a 3:1 difference in the score to take the T1.

Tian Ye and Zhao Lijie from EDG team have already proved themselves through the stage of League of Legends S11 Finals. As a "Grand Slam" player and a "veteran" of the team, Tian Ye's rich experience in big matches and delicate skills put fans at ease. Last but not least is Zhuo Ding from JDG team, who is considered as the No.1 Chinese mid laner with impeccable skills.

The Korean team's lineup is also star-studded, with Choi Youqi (ID: Zeus), Lee Sang-hyuk (ID: Faker), and Ryu Min-analyzer (ID: Keria) from T1, Park Jae-hyuk (ID: Ruler) and Seo Jin-hyuk (ID: Kanavi) from JDG, and Jung Ji-hoon (ID: Chak) from GEN. Jung Ji-hoon (ID: Chovy).

At the Hangzhou Asian Games, the "proud" Korean team took the unprecedented step of choosing players from regions other than the LCK, in order to effectively target the Chinese team. Park Jae-hyuk and Seo Jin-hyuk, as meritorious members of the JDG team, have helped the team to win the LPL League Championship and the MSI Championship, and are very familiar with the Chinese players. They know Chinese players very well. Zhuo Ding of the Chinese team is his club mate, and the three players of the BLG team have lost to them many times, so they have a certain psychological advantage.

There is also the middle of the Lee Sang Hyuk player, as the most successful player in the history of the League of Legends e-sports, has achieved countless achievements, known as the "Great Demon King" by the players. However, Lee Sang-hyuk, who is now 27 years old, is currently playing the role of a spiritual pillar in the Korean team and has yet to take the field in the knockout stage.

- WE team won the championship

As the League of Legends e-competition has become more and more mature, there are fewer and fewer off-court factors, but the gap between the hard power of China and Korea before is becoming more and more obvious. In the S3 World Finals, the all-Chinese Imperials were defeated 3-0 by the rising SKT in the final, and since then the Chinese team has begun a heartbreaking journey of "anti-Korean".

Fans witnessed the domination of Samsung's ten sons and the SKT team under the leadership of Lee Sang-hyuk won three consecutive world championships, while the Chinese team had no success on the stage of the world championships, and even witnessed the Korean civil war in the Bird's Nest in S7.

In the end, it was very difficult to win with a score of 3-2, at that time only 17-year-old Yu Wenbo player also dedicated the famous scene of "blocking the professional forward flash", so that the name Yu Wenbo is remembered by players around the world.

After KT, IG was invincible and easily crushed the European team Fnatic 3-0 in the finals to win the LPL's first World Championship. That night, the cheers of congratulations to IG echoed across the sky, and the news of IG's victory was broadcast on the news network.

IG team's victory also let Chinese fans realize that the strength of the two countries before is shrinking, in the subsequent S9 quarter-finals, the Korean army routed, only SKT team advanced to the next round, South Korea's GRF team was in the team IG 3-1 easily take away, DWG team also defeated the European G2 team, and finally from the LPL region of the FPX to take the title, the LPL region also completed the 2 consecutive championships.

However, in the final stage of S10 held in Shanghai, South Korea's DWG team easily beat LPL's SN team 3-1, blocking the LPL's three consecutive titles.

From the old WE, the old royal family and the dark forces OMG team, a batch of Chinese teams fighting in the "anti-Korean" first line, the Chinese team from facing the gap to narrow the gap and finally complete the reversal, walked through the youth of countless e-sports people, the Hangzhou Asian Games semifinals of the Chinese team lost to the South Korean team, so that the gaming people once again realized that the Sino-Korean gap, the LPL region still needs to be a good place for the Chinese team to play. The gap between China and South Korea, the LPL still need to continue to progress, from the world's first region there is still a long way to go. Finally, we hope that the Chinese League of Legends team will achieve more success in the future world tournaments and climb the peak.
