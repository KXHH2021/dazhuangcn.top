## Riot Games officially confirms that Battle of Two Cities will count as the main story of the League of Legends universe

LOL studio head Meddler said in reddit forums to answer the netizen's question, the battle of the two cities will now be regarded as the hero alliance universe of the main story, and the hero alliance universe of the main worldview in line.

And Meddler said that just because Battle for the Twin Cities didn't show the entirety of Pilotwolf and Zuan doesn't mean that some characters who didn't make an appearance aren't in that worldview, like Mondo who didn't show up in the first season. But that doesn't mean that Mondo doesn't exist in the Battle of the Twin Cities worldview. It's just that too many quests appearing in one production would be overload.

In addition to Hollywood's professional level of subplotting and scriptwriting, and the superbly fitting and catchy theme song, Battle of Two Cities' graphics are also at a high level that ordinary animation can't reach. Whether it's the fight scenes or the characters' movements, they're all rich, natural, and have a strong sense of impact, making it feel as if every shot is in 3D.

Take the 6th episode of Azure and Jinx meet, but was attacked by unknown people, for example, just two minutes of fight scenes, fist to flesh, coupled with the awesome handling of the camera, violence and aesthetics at the same time. There are so many other violent aesthetic shots like this in the show that almost every fight scene is an animated ceiling, and you can see the funds burning in every frame.

It is said that this drama is the fist six years to grind a sword carefully polished out, all the scenes are not modeling production, but pure 2D hand-painted, yes, you understand correctly, that is the meaning of an angle is a separate painting, coupled with 3D characters using stylized rendering, to achieve the 4K film only have the experience of visual effects.

Of course, the excellent production and strong visual impact are important reasons for the popularity of "Battle of Two Cities", but the more crucial thing is the plot, which is the core of attracting attention for a long time. In the aired episodes, in fact, also hides a lot of suspense, such as why the transformation of the explosion is so huge, seemingly overnight from the true innocence of the explosion blackened into a crazy almost out of control Jinx, Hilko in the middle of what kind of role, whether the use of drugs in the control of her. There's also the Hales technology, for the time being it looks like Pitt is better off because of it, but it's questionable if it will backfire later on.

At the end of episode 6, Jace forces Pi Cheng's father, Professor Heimerdinger, to retire, a seriously ill Victor returns to his homeland and appears to be experimenting with genetic mutations, and Ui is taken captive by a masked figure - how much of an impact all of this will have on Pi Cheng and Zuan, whose relationship is already precarious, no one knows, and will have to wait for subsequent episodes to answer the question.
