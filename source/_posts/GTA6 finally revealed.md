The promo has also caused gamers to blow up en masse. This means that GTA6 has finally crossed the "new folder" stage, and finally no longer live in the netizen's flirtation.



To know, from the GTA5 online has been ten years past, in recent years around the sequel online has been leaked, there has been controversy, there has been reverie also have not seen the end of the wait. Not long ago, there was even a netizen who said that his health seemed to be deteriorating and he was worried that he wouldn't be healthy enough to wait until GTA6 was released, so he began to discipline himself to quit smoking.

When I saw the 2025 launch date at the end of the promotional video, I was in a trance for a while, thinking that I should be at the end of 2024 right now.

According to the trailer and some past discussions, GTA6 is based on the US state of Florida, including Miami, the "Sin City" of the series, and the story is based on a dual protagonist narrative structure with a male and female protagonist.



Considering the fact that the game has been in development for nearly 10 years, the amount of content will probably be more than most gamers expect, in addition to the graphical improvements.

And if many of the past reveals have emphasized GTA6's efforts on the level of internal volume, this first look trailer reveals that the new title is still trying to plumb the depths of content. After all, GTA5 and Wildstorm 2 have long since proven that R-Star knows enough about open worlds.



For example, in the trailer, R Star has made a lot of references to the UI layout of various short videos and news, which may also mean that GTA6 will introduce more and more complex online gameplay in addition to separate offline experience elements.

At the same time, this system also carries a few multiplayer features. Considering R-Star's past success with GTA5 and GTAOL, GTA6 should also weight multiplayer gameplay, such as rich character coordination, a multi-dimensional tactical system, different matchmaking combinations to play, and so on.



In T2's earnings call on November 8, 2023, CEO Strauss Zelnick had mentioned that the results of GTA5 and GTAOL had far exceeded the management's expectations, so they would also gradually deepen the relationship with the player community through new products. And it seems not too surprising if GTA6 evolves into a large online social platform in the future.



Of course, going back to the single-player game itself, this content may also correspond to more intelligent NPCs, who will update their own social software and react to the events in the game, focusing on a "life of their own".

Looking back over the past decade, there have been two unanswered questions in the gaming world: who is still buying GTA5, and who isn't. After all, there's no reason why GTA5, an open-world game that launched in 2013, should still be at the top of the market in 2023. What's more, EPIC has even offered a free game in the past.



However, the fact remains that GTA5 has always been a neon light in Steam's weekly sales charts, and with 190 million sales, it's a game that's outclassed by the majority of games out there. It's no wonder that the trailer for GTA6 had countless gamers typing "Witness History" on their pop-up screens.



However, the length of 1 minute 31 seconds of the promotional video is really limited to show things, we are also curious not only about the quality of GTA6, but what kind of new experience it can bring to the players, and how much inspiration to the industry. Will it become the "that game" of the future that you don't have to mention by name?



# With that in mind, every day in 2024 seems to be getting a little more anxious.
