## LOL the new version of Galen strong top!Top list list big change, Noh hand rare fall to T2!

The 13.20 version is a very big impact on the position of the top single, the changes in the field allow the top single to have more 1v1 time, more test of personal operation. But the changes to the plating economy weakened the ability to snowball, and the conqueror weakened the ability to spar. It's safe to say that for some warrior players, the new version of top laner will be very different compared to 13.19 and previous versions. Although it's not so much that you have to adapt all over again, this aspect of the hero's damage is definitely going to roll over if you don't pay attention to it.

Shortly after the 13.20 update, the top laner list has changed dramatically, and OPGG's Korean top laner list is currently topped by Galen, who is the only "OP" top laner at the moment. He's followed by Green Steel Shadow, Sword Demon and Stoner, three of the oldest top laners in the game. Next is Ugarte, who stole a handful of rankings by his high win rate, but his appearance rate is so low that he probably won't be seen for another two days. Lastly, there's Swordie, Weapon, Mondo, Orn and Noob.

You can see that compared to the previous version, this version of the tanky top laner is obviously a lot more, but the ranking of the good tanky Noob is falling, just barely squeezed into the top 10, which is honestly very unreasonable, because the Noob is one of the best tanky fighters.

Nuo hand 7.93% of the debut rate in the top 10 singles count a lot, indicating that this data has been a lot of singles to try after the results of the election, not good to play, and ultimately only 49% of the winning rate. So so look at this version of the talent and some aspects of the weakening of the Northerner quite a big impact, I do not know the back of the Northerner can not return to the top 10.

The platinum and above list of the national service and the Korean service has some differences, the national service is now the first top list is the dog head, the green steel shadow only ranked in the 9th, and the noob is also the 10th. and compared with the Korean service, there is no AoN weapon but more VN and Sellars, as well as the Oroi. Galen is also a strong hero and is a version T1 top laner.

The fact that the two servers' data are so similar is enough to show that this version of tanks is indeed a lot easier to play than the previous version. Otherwise, Dog Head could not have rushed strongly to the first in the national service, Galen rushed strongly to the first in the Korean service, and this version of the top laner will be even better to play tanks to win.

And according to the designer's previous revelations, the rise of this version of the tank may just be a beginning, the latter several versions of the tank should be able to taste the sweetness. For example, the designer early previewed the durability update, tank heroes can again eat the maximum durability update benefits. Another example is that the designers want to curb the excessive output of the League of Legends, which also means that tanks have more room to play. Not to mention the removal of mythic equipment later, the current version of the problem of excessive damage, when the mythic equipment is gone, tanks will be more comfortable.

Overall, it's definitely a good idea to practice tanky heroes in these recent versions, and not just on the top lanes, but on the field as well. Including this version, the later versions are the world of the tool hitters, the wild core will be very difficult to play, the toolman hitters become the version of the favourite.

Can only say that the wind and water turn it, playing field this position is strong for so long, the warrior upper single also bullied the tank upper single this long, and now it is also the turn of the tank strong, just do not know when can wait for the day of the middle single AP mage strong.
