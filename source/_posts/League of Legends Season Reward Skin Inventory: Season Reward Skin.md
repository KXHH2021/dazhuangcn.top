First let's take a look at the season reward skins for the S1 season. At that time, League of Legends was not yet popular in the national service, so in the US service, the Triumph Hero Garvin IV became the exclusive character for the season rewards. At that time, there was no segmentation system, so as long as the ranking score was over 1700 points, you could get this skin. Wow, it was amazing to have this skin at that time!

Since the S2 season, League of Legends has started to introduce the Victory series of bonus skins. Cana, the Goddess of Victory, was the bonus skin for the S2 season, and it was the first time Wind Woman received a Victory Series skin. The skin was given away to all players ranked above 1,400 points at the time, as the Wind Woman was very popular amongst support roles.
